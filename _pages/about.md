# Welcome to my webpage!

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Verona](https://www.dsu.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=79634&lang=it). I'm also a Research Affiliate of the [Italian Centre for Electoral Studies (Centro Italiano Studi Elettorali – CISE)](https://cise.luiss.it/chi-siamo/le-persone/) and an Adjunct Professor at the [Department of Political Science, LUISS Guido Carli](https://www.luiss.it/faculty/354453). Previously, I held visiting positions at KU Leuven's "Voting & Democracy" research group (2025) and Sciences Po's CEVIPOF (2022).

I specialise in left politics, group-based politics, and issue politics. I'm especially interested in how conflict over societal inequalities translates into both party strategies and political behaviour along social group lines. I also work on other projects in the broader field of electoral studies. 

My research appears in journals such as the [European Journal of Political Research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-political-research/article/who-prioritises-what-determinants-and-measurement-of-voters-issue-prioritisation/E85C711B0698149F280FA000C70A5E66), [Perspectives on Politics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-political-research/article/who-prioritises-what-determinants-and-measurement-of-voters-issue-prioritisation/E85C711B0698149F280FA000C70A5E66), [Electoral Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026137942500112X), and [Social Politics](https://academic.oup.com/sp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sp/jxae035/7965949), among others. In 2024, I was the first recipient of the ["Mario Caciagli Award"](https://oaj.fupress.net/index.php/qoe/announcement/view/133) for Best Article published in the Italian Journal of Electoral Studies.

In November 2023, I completed my PhD in Political Science at LUISS Guido Carli. Earlier, I studied in the UK (MSc, LSE) and Italy (Bachelor's degree, Sapienza University of Rome).

My first single-authored monograph, "Varieties of Social Democracy in Western Europe: The Impact of External Constraints on Ideological Differences", is forthcoming with Palgrave Macmillan.
