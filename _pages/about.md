# Welcome to my webpage!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Verona. I am also a Research Affiliate of the Italian Centre for Electoral Studies (Centro Italiano Studi Elettorali – CISE) and an Adjunct Professor at the Department of Political Science, LUISS Guido Carli. Previously, I held visiting positions at KU Leuven's "Voting & Democracy" research group (2025) and Sciences Po's CEVIPOF (2022).

I am interested in left politics and how conflict over societal inequalities translates politically into both party strategies and political behaviour. I also work on other projects in the broader field of electoral studies. My research appears in journals such as the [European Journal of Political Research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-political-research/article/who-prioritises-what-determinants-and-measurement-of-voters-issue-prioritisation/E85C711B0698149F280FA000C70A5E66), [Perspectives on Politics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/left-governmental-power-and-the-reduction-of-inequalities-in-western-europe-18712020/ED555D70627A4A3D57B2BD9B708C5F55), [Electoral Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026137942500112X), and [Social Politics](https://academic.oup.com/sp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sp/jxae035/7965949), among others.

In November 2023, I completed my PhD in Political Science at LUISS Guido Carli. I was educated in the UK (MSc, LSE) and Italy (Bachelor's degree, Sapienza University of Rome).

My first single-authored monograph, "Varieties of Social Democracy in Western Europe: The Impact of External Constraints on Ideological Differences", is under contract with Palgrave Macmillan.
