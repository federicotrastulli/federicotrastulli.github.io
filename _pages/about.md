# Welcome to my webpage!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Verona. I am also a Research Affiliate of the Italian Centre for Electoral Studies (Centro Italiano Studi Elettorali – CISE) and an Adjunct Professor at the Department of Political Science, LUISS Guido Carli. Previously, I held visiting positions at KU Leuven's "Voting & Democracy" research group (2025) and Sciences Po's CEVIPOF (2022).

I am interested in left politics and how conflict over societal inequalities translates politically into both party strategies and political behaviour. I also work on other projects in the broader field of electoral studies.

In November 2023, I completed my PhD in Political Science at LUISS Guido Carli. I was educated in the UK (MSc, LSE) and Italy (Bachelor's degree, Sapienza University of Rome).

My first single-authored monograph, "Varieties of Social Democracy in Western Europe: The Impact of External Constraints on Ideological Differences", is under contract with Palgrave Macmillan.
